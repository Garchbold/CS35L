Switched to a new branch 'quote'

4,5. emacs /src/cmp.c
I used the command C-x 4 a to open the change log and then wrote a description 
of the changes that our patch was supposed to make:
* cmp.c: I applied a patch to change all ` (backticks) to ' (apostrophes).

6. No I have to commit the changes made by the patch:

git add .

I then check if they have been added by calling git status, after this I 
committed the changes:

 git commit -m “ChangeLog”

 The -m prompts the commit to add a message.

7. git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
 
 scp archbold@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:~/CS35L/lab4/diffutils/formatted-patch.
 txt ~/Documents
 I scp-ed my formatted patch and sent it to my partner Daniel Berestov.

8/9.
 scp ~/Documents/formatted-patch.txt archbold@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.
 edu:~/CS35L/lab4/

I uploaded his patch to the server, and applied it to an original version of diffutils:

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

git am < formatted-patch.txt

./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/u/be/ugrad/archbold/CS35L/lab4
make

make distdir
I cd-ed into the directory it made and checked to see if the files showed up in the CHANGELOG file. They were there as expected


10.
I git cloned the emacs file:

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git

and then called gitk on it, however it did not work. So I had to install XQuartz and then log onto the 01 server:

ssh -X archbold@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu

I then called gitk on the emacs repository, and the GUI interface popped up and it was easy to find the last merge before 1-25-15.
