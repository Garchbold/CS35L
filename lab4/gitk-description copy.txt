gitk description

There were five main windows in the gitk GUI interface.

1) The top left window displayed a list of all commits and git actions 
with a description message of the change made. It also had a little 
visual animation on the left side to made the series of commits more 
easy to understand and keep track of. 

2) The top middle window matched up line to line with the first 
window, and it provided the name and email of the user who made the 
commit.

3) The top right window also matched up line to line with the first 
and second windows, and this gave the date and time that the 
respective commit was made.

4) The bottom left window provided the in depth information about the
highlighted commit. It included who authored it, who committed it, the 
parent commits, the child commits, and the branches.

5) The bottom right window provided any comments made about the given 
commit and could be toggled between Patch and Tree.

In between windows 1,2,3 and 4,5 there was a bar that included the SHA1 ID number, the row number and a couple other options.
