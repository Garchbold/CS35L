Lab 6: SSH


To start this lab, I had to set up OpenSSH:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
This command showed me which open ssh pacakges I had on my server.

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client
I used these commands to install the needed packages: server and client.


For the first part of the lab, I had to create an account on my server for my partner to connect to:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen
This command generates the public and private keys. It asked where I would like the keys to be stored, and I just pressed enter, storing them in the default location

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo useradd /home/ap -m ap
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo passwd ap
These two commands create the account under the given name in the specified directory. It also gives the account a password.

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cd /home/ap
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir .ssh
Then I had to cd into the created account, and make a ssh directory.

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo chown -R ap .ssh
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh
This gave ownership and all other permissions (read, write, execute) to the user.

My partner connected to my server and called the if config command, and it showed that she was on my IP address, then to double check she made a new directory and I went into /home/ap and saw he directory she made.

For the second part of the lab, I had to connect to my partners server on the account she made for me:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen
This command generates the public and private keys.

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-copy-id -i is_rsa.pub username@partner_IP_address
This command copies my public key to my partners server. I can now log onto the server

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-add is_rsa
This command copies my public key to my partners server. 

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh username@partner_IP_address
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh -X username@partner_IP_address
I tested -X port forwarding in this command. I logged in and called xterm, and the GUi displayed in the terminal

I also checked ifconfig and it showed my partners IP address, indicating a successful ssh connection.
