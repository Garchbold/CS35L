I downloaded the buggy coreutils file onto my home machine and then 
used scp to upload it to the server:

scp ~/Downloads/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz archbold@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.
edu:~/CS35L/lab5/


I then untar-ed it and built it:

tar -xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
./configure --prefix=/u/be/ugrad/archbold/CS35L/lab5/coreutils-with-bug
make

Trying to build the buggy coreutils, I got an error signaling that 
there were conflicting types for futimens:

utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^

I then uploaded the patch from the wesite page:

 wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

Then I used this patch to make the necessary changes:

patch -p0 < coreutils.diff 

patching file lib/utimens.c
patching file lib/utimens.h
patching file src/copy.c
patching file src/tee.c
patching file src/touch.c

To reproduce the bug I ran the code in the example:

$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ~/CS35L/lab5/coreutils-with-bug-patched/src/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

-rw-r--r-- 1 archbold beugrad 0 2016-02-03 21:01:01.657785857 +0000 now

Now that the new patch has successfully been added, I rebuild the 
coreutils-with-bugs:

./configure --prefix=/u/be/ugrad/archbold/CS35L/lab5/coreutils-with-bug


Looking at the patch, we can see that every change made by the 
renaming patch 
literally just deleted every case of futimens, and called it 
coreutils_futimens:

-  ok = (futimens (fd, (fd == STDOUT_FILENO ? NULL : file), t) == 0);
+  ok = (coreutils_futimens (fd, (fd == STDOUT_FILENO ? NULL : file), t
) == 0);

It also did this for the function tee.


emacs ~/CS35L/lab5/coreutils-with-bug-patched/src/ls.c
M-x gdb
delete su and input the executabe ls then by looking at the src code 
for ls.c. 

I used this command to run gdb without emacs:
gdb --args ./ls -lt /tmp/wwi-armistice /tmp/now /tmp/now1

I know the problem occurs in qsort from office hours, so I set a 
breakpoint there. The error lies in the func parameter of the q sort 
function. So searching (C-s func) for func, I find that it is in 
sort_files and look more into that function.

sort_files contains a switch statement checking for atime, mtime and 
ctime.

Since ls -lt prints the contents as a list by their time of last 
modification we are interested in mtime in the sort_files function

In sort files, I can see that the function dealing with m_time is 
compare_mtime so I search for that and find it at line 2884.

Running gdb with a break at 2884, I get:

static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll)
; }

And I can see that compare_mtime calls cmp_mtime, and stepping into 
this I can see that it calls timespec_cmp

(gdb) s
timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:48
48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;

I found that this function is located in /lib/timespec.h by using the 
command
find ./coreutils-with-bug | xargs grep "timespec_cmp"

I also saw that I had to disable the compiler optimization:
./configure CFLAGS="-g -O0"
make

I added these lines into timespec_cmp so that I could see what was 
going on in order to track the mistake:

  printf("\nThe a and b values are:\n");
  printf("%d", a.tv_sec);
  printf("%d", b.tv_sec);

When I run it with these additions it prints out:
The a and b values are:
-1613826000, 1454448533

I know that this subtraction causes overflow from hints in class. So 
inorder to make sure that the subtraction is valid I changed all the 
types in timespec_cmp from ints to long longs.

Also instead of returning diff's actual value,  we just want to return 
1, 0, -1, because as it is now:

  return diff ? diff : (long long)a.tv_nsec - (long long)b.tv_nsec;

This statement doesnt really do anything.

After making my changes, I untared another version of coreutils and used the diff command to comapre the changes made:

diff coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h coreutils-with-bug-patched/lib/timespec.h > lab5temp.diff

Then use C-x 4-a to change the ChangeLog

I combine to change log and the differences to make the final diff statement:


cat ChangeLog lab5temp.diff > lab5.diff
